# Choose Your Own Adventure: The Sun Fox

Constructed a JavaScript game modeled after the Create Your Own Adventures books by creating interactive onclick events that offer the player new options, images and scenarios. 
Programmed to deconstruct and pass a number of objects through a singular function in order to progress the game until player quits or reaches the end.

### Built with
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned
The first draft of this project just consisted of functions passing functions until the game ended. I rebuilt this project to make it object oriented. Instead of functions passing through eachother a number of objects pass through one function. I learned how to pass functions by deconstructing objects and how to set a function as an object property.
