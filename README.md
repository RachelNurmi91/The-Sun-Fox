## Project Summary
Created a website with multiple landing pages using the Bootstrap library, custom CSS, and HTML. The site is responsive on all browser sizes, including mobile devices. Select JavaScript elements have been added, including a nav bar that changes into toggler format on smaller screens and a clickable arrow that allows visitors to quickly return to the top of the website once they have scrolled down. During this project, I learned how to customize bootstraps pre-set CSS classes. I was challenged to make their generic nav bar into one that fits the color scheme and design of the website. I also learned how to implement a "to the top" button to bring viewers to the top of a long landing page. For this button, I had to combine my prior CSS skills with JavaScript functions.
